 apsr.2.desc:0 "$RULER$, while observing a supernova, our astronomers received an encrypted signal originating from a planet in an otherwise unremarkable system situated near the exploding star. Although we have managed to decrypt it, the better part of the message was distorted by the explosion. However, the general idea of the contents was inferred. The message speaks of wonderous planets present within our galaxy; from planets made entirely of strange materials to ones where mysterious alien artifacts reside. The location of such places must have been part of the lost fragments of the signal. While we do not know who sent it, we remain hopeful the contents weren't a lie, and that someday we may find at least one of these planets."

Bequeathed they had been to live in peace, never knowing disease, hunger, war or any suffering. It was a time of prosperity and piety, as life grew and glorified its creators. Yet such golden age couldn't last, for the Dark Day arrived. The sky rained fire, bringing death and terror.
