Approaching one of the planets at a speed lower than the speed of light, I've suddenly received a signal from one of the sensors. We scanned the planet - it turned out to have characteristics that are very similar to ones our own planets have. \nIt was decided to examine it more closely by the onboard telescopes, and then we've noticed reddish glowing on the darker side of the planet. \nIs it caused by some kind of rocks? By some liquid or some gas? Maybe microogranisms? Or plants? But there's no point in contemplating. We'd already decided to land. Our pilot did so very skillfully. «Turn off the engines», «activate the «Perimeter» and all the external lights». And we are finally there»§!"
