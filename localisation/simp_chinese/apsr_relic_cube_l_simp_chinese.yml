However, this seemingly gloomy event caused joy and jubilation among the research team. The new, experimental scanner, assembled on the spot from the old one, confirmed their guesses: all this time there was a huge spatial pocket inside the planet, which is almost 10 times larger than the planet itself. It contains an unimaginable amount of matter, including minerals. This pocket is shielded in some unknown way; it can only be detected below a certain depth mark in the planet's crust. According to preliminary data, the pocket is stable, but from time to time a «spatial echo» passes through it, which can absorb some objects in the pocket, which is what happened to some team members. Right now scientists are busy developing personal «echo» reflectors to prevent further disappearances. Unfortunately, it is not possible to return the lost workers. The source of the echo, judging by the scanner's readings, is at an even greater depth in the same direction."

The ships are now positioned close to each other, and researchers have to cut through their hulls. Notably, the pressure is also dropping significantly; soon we'll have to work in pressurised suits, and in some places it is already necessary to install space-grade airlocks. For the first time, a decrease in gravity was recorded, and as we move deeper, it begins to decrease exponentially. And today, the scanner suddenly showed a spherical cavity dead ahead in which, apparently, there is an absolute vacuum.\nThe echo reflectors were successfully tested and issued to all excavation participants."

 apsr_arcrel.207.desc:0 "We have reached the inner surface of the cavity we found on the scanner. At its boundary, the force of gravity disappears completely; inside it is vacuum, just as we suspected.\nThe equipment placed on the cavity's surface has located the source of the echo and, apparently, the spatial pocket generator in the center of said cavity. This is definitely an artificial, incredibly complex spherical mechanism, which everyone agreed to call «the collector». A dull and pulsating blue glow emanates from it; from time to time it expells whole chunks of matter onto the outside of the cavity. It can be both useless substances and valuable minerals, or even accidentally found ships. It is unknown exactly how, but matter ejected by the collector's mechanism is pressed into the cavity's border; after some time the surface becomes perfectly smooth, and the added matter goes «up» to the surface. Our scientists surmise that this collector works on the principle of «transporting» the matter found in outer space into its own dimensional pocket. The collector was left unattended for many millions of years, during which it gathered and duly stored matter in a spatial pocket. Apparently, now the pocket is overflowing and from time to time the collector sends an «echo» to clean it; this, however, wasn't enough, and eventually an entire planet formed on the pocket's outer side due to the gravitational pull of all the accumulated matter.\nThe lead scientist believes that we can take control of the collector and reconfigure it to receive useful minerals. To do that, they want to transport parts of a small research ship all the way through to the cavity in order to assemble it and approach the collector."

 # Этап 8
 apsr_arcrel.208.title:0 "Breakthrough"
 apsr_arcrel.208.desc:0 "The special assembly of a research ship was a resounding success. All attempts to directly interact with the collector weren't successful, however, unexpectedly, the ship's radar detected an unknown object, rotating quickly around the collector. Although it was not possible to stop it completely, we were able to reduce its orbital speed. Immediately after that, the collector's behavior started to differ - the brightness of the glow changed, as well, apparently, as the frequency of matter emission. Further attempts to interact with the object using various fields and emissions allowed us to change the collector's behavior more significantly. Apparently the object, the shape of which most closely resembles a cube, is some kind of management console. The science team has quickly figured out its basic functionality. Unfortunately, it turned out to be impossible to make the collector continuously receive the minerals we need; it requires so-called «relaxation» periods, when absolutely random matter is thrown into the pocket. However, we managed to completely turn off the echo. We weren't able to find any possibility for reverse engineering; the spatial pocket's inner workings remain a mystery, and we are unlikely to be able to reproduce it. The collector is currently completely stable, there is no danger of its failure, and mineral obtainment, according to the team, is optimal. The only remaining step is to establish an infrastructure for the minerals transportation to the surface of the planet.\nThe cube, however, is much more interesting. According to the leader of the excavation, the management of the collector might only be a basic part of its capabilities. Our scientists continue to carefully study and conduct various experiments with it."

Logs:\n\n«On April 26, at 1:23 am capital time (21:23 - colonial), two of the eight power units of the Largesium power plant were destroyed. The incident was explosive in nature and the reactor, as it was found out, was completely destroyed. A huge amount of radioactive and toxic substances were released into the enviroment at the time of the explosion. Simultaneously, a fluctuation of tectonic activity took place, estimated to have produced earthquakes ranging around 11.0—12.9 on the Richter scale. This disaster created a huge, gaping crevice on the continent; furthermore, it continues to expand, absorbing literally everything in its path! We have managed to estimate and track the rate with which the continental crack expands, and it seems to be slowing down. The incident is the largest disaster of its kind that has occured in the entire history of our empire, both in terms of infrastructural damage and casualties. More than 500 million citizens died from radiation sickness, which struck them in the first hours of the accident. Around 332 million citizens were evacuated from the 900-kilometer zone, however, most of the population of nearby settlements is still in the affected area. Considerable resources have already been mobilized to eliminate the first effects. The group of leading seismologists, geologists, and specialists in nuclear physics assigned to the commission on the current situation have strong concerns about the ongoing reaction of the molten Largesium reactor core. According to their convincing theories and no less convincing research, the melting reaction of the nucleus is not unstoppable, because the active zone, which once held back all sorts of manifestations of enormous power, is now destroyed. Stopping the core from the outside is impossible, attempts already been made in this sense, with no success so far. We should organise a new expedition to get into the center of the reactor. It is noteworthy that an experimental boring machine is already being actively tested, capable of holding back a squall of radiation that is fatal to any organism, biological or synthetic. We require your permission, because the boring machine works on unstable energy sources, such as dark matter. There is a small risk that the equipment will detonate, along with the crew, that will be required on board. In the worst case, the detonation of the machine will trigger a chain reaction with the Largesium already present on the planet, potentially splitting apart the entire planet, an eternal reminder that some forces will always be beyond our control.»"

The equipment will be dropped from orbit, together with the completed crew, directly into the depths of the catastrophic fault and will begin its work immediately. Unfortunately, there also bad news. Our science drones have conducted new calculations and experiments - finding out that all our available sensors, current and experimental are not able to work in such extreme conditions. We will not be able to maintain touch with the expedition once it begins, as the subspace connection does not seem to work. We are still studying this phenomenon, but the result is again disappointing. The crew will remain blind and mute, and without the possibility of return.\nHonestly, we will not be able to lift them to the surface. We had too little time to develop and test the prototype. Their mission... It’s a one way road... A zone with a high concentration of radioactive substances will last for millennia, and this is on condition that their mission will be successful, and they will be able to drown the Core. Not a single excavator or bulldozer can withstand such a barrage of radiation, even covered in monstrous protection. They will be buried there forever."
